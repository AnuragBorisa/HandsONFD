## Overview

StackForge provides a structured approach to mastering full-stack development by solving real-world problems. Each challenge emphasizes clean code, testing, documentation, and performance considerations, culminating in a professional portfolio of completed projects.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/StackForge.git
   cd StackForge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (if applicable)

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Begin Day 1**

   * Open `JSques.md` for the first JavaScript challenge.
   * Create a new branch (e.g., `day-01-js`).
   * Implement the solution under `solutions/js/day-01/`.
4. **Submit your work**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Day 01: Debounce & Throttle Utility"
   git push origin day-01-js
   ```
5. **Open a pull request** and merge into `main` when complete. Proceed to the next challenge.

---

## Daily Workflow

* **Morning**: Review the challenge description.
* **Midday**: Develop the solution, write tests, and document edge cases.
* **Afternoon**: Perform performance checks and add any necessary notes.
* **End of Day**: Commit, push, and create a pull request for review and merge.

---

## Objectives

* Demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
* Produce clean, well-tested, and documented code.
* Build a portfolio of end-to-end solutions suitable for technical interviews.

---

## Best Practices

* Adopt test-driven development to ensure reliability.
* Include a brief README in each solution directory summarizing your approach.
* Profile performance and record any benchmarks or trade-offs.
* Revisit and refactor earlier solutions after completing all challenges.
